# Pen Plotter Mount with Spring for 3D Printer

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2369089

## Summary

This is a spring loaded pen mount for 2D plotting with a 3D printer. I included files for both a hexagonal pen (which tend to crack from the set screw) and a standard circular Bic pen (usually made of softer plastic). I have designed it to mount to the gantry plate of my homemade 3D printer. I have included STEP files so that it can be easily modified to suit your needs. Please share as a remix if you do so!

Features

- Spring loaded so pen pressure depends on z height when plotting
- Includes set screw located in mount so that pen can be retracted and held up above extruder nozzles. This allows you to switch between 2D and 3D printing without uninstalling the entire pen/mount.
- Fits standard Bic style pen

Hardware Needed

- 2 M3 nuts and 2 M3 screws (approx 6-8mm long). 1 set is for the pen clamp and is always secured. 1 set is for the pen mount and is secured when you want to raise the pen out of the way so that you can use your printer for 3D printing without fully removing the pen or pen mount.
- 1 spring. Mine is 11.2mm OD by 45mm long when uncompressed. Model can be modified to fit a spring of your choice.
- 1 [Bic Cristal](http://amzn.to/2qTluRh) style pen (or standard circular Bic pen)
- Mounting hardware. I used 1 binder clip and 1 M6x6 bolt with an M6 nut. Your printer will likely be different. STEP file is easily modified to remove my mounting tabs and add your own.

Notes:
Rotate pen mount so that it prints on flat back.

Pen mount set screw hole will beed to have a single layer clear from it, either by drilling out the hole or just screwing through it with your M3 bolt.
